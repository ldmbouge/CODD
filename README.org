* CODD

CODD is a C++ library that implements the DDOpt framework.
It has:
- restricted / exact / relax diagrams
- state definition, initial, terminal and state merging functions separated
- equivalence predicate for sink.
- restricted construction is truly bounded now (not truncation based).

** Dependencies
You need ~graphviz~ (The ~dot~ binary) to create graph images. It happens
automatically when the ~display~ method is called. Temporary files are created
in ~/tmp~ and then macOS ~open~ command is used (via ~fork/execlp~)  to open the generated
PDF. The same functionality needs to be added on Linux (different API to pop up a viewer).

** C++ Standard
You need a C++-20 capable compiler. gcc and clang should both work. I work on macOS, and
I use the mainline clang coming with Xcode.

The implementation uses templates and concepts to factor the code.

** Build system
This is ~cmake~. Simply do the following
#+begin_src bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j4
#+end_src
And it will compile the whole thing. To compile in optimized mode, simply change
the variable ~CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE~ from ~Debug~ to ~Release~ as shown below:
#+begin_src bash
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
#+end_src

** Examples
To be found in the ~examples~ folder
- ~coloringtoy~ tiny coloring bench (same as in python)
- ~foo~ maximum independent set (toy size)
- ~tsp~ TSP solver (same as in python)
- ~gruler~ golomb ruler (usage <size> <ubOnLabels>)
- ~knapsack~ Binary knapsack
- ~MISP~ for the Maximum independent set

Each benchmark may have several variants that are incresingly faster (because they use local bounds, dominance, better state representation, etc...). For instance, ~tsp_test4~ is one of the variant for TSP. Most executable do take an input for the filename containing the instance as well as the width. For instance running ~tsp_test4~ can be done as follows:
#+begin_src bash
./tsp_test4 ../data/atsp/br17.atsp 32
#+end_src
from the ~build~ folder to run on the br17 instance with a width of 32. The output would look like this:

#+begin_src bash

Every 5 seconds, the branch and bound reports the number of nodes, current node value, incumbent value, duality gap and the time since the start. The last line (with the ~Done~) says that the optimal was 39, that it took 13912 nodes to close the optimality proof, that no nodes where discarded because of a dominance and that the optimum was found after 3.063s and the proof took 31.995s (if there was a limit, it was _not_ reached). 

** Unit test
In the ~test~ folder

** Library
All of it in the ~src~ folder

* Tasks
** DONE Decent set of integer implementation
CLOSED: [2024-01-29 Mon 19:01]
On my own heap.
With template overload that is size dependent (up to label 64, all ops should be O(1))
After that, it should be O(label/64). Unless we start using the 128 bit registers ;-)
** DONE Check and fix leaks (the cache should be deallocated, not _an)
CLOSED: [2024-01-29 Mon 13:46]
** TODO Implement instance reader for tsp to do bigger instances
Done for coloring.
** TODO Implement instance reader for MISP
** TODO Rename MISP (~foo~) to misptoy ;-)
** DONE Profile and pick up the low hanging fruits 
CLOSED: [2024-01-30 Tue 22:13]
** DONE Fix calls to find in order to remove from _an
CLOSED: [2024-01-31 Wed 12:23]
- Those should be O(1) via locators.
- Implement the trick to O(1) removal (affects mergeLayer / truncate)
- I now directly link the ANode with each other. It avoids the needs for location. Removal can still be O(1).
** DONE Fix calls to find before updateKey in heaps
CLOSED: [2024-01-31 Wed 07:28]
- Heap is already location aware
- We need to track the location (by node id, we have those)
- Then use the location to have an O(1) operation (affects computeBest & computeBestBackward)
** DONE Change the makeNode / duplicate so that hash is computed only once (not twice).
CLOSED: [2024-01-31 Wed 14:54]
- Use opaque ADT in Hashtable to support that (HTAt is the opaque type)
** Experiment with permanent state cache
*** segregate Edge allocator
*** DONE keep the node cache (at least for relaxed) so that they get reused
This did not work. It creates and keeps far too many nodes. Collision lists were getting too long. It's far easier to clear and rebuild as many DDs are quite small. 
CLOSED: [2024-02-15 Thu 16:46]
*** clear the edge allocator since those must be rebuild
*** runs the risk of runaway node cache. Maybe clear periodically? (Every 10K B&B node)
** DONE Implement a label generator
CLOSED: [2024-02-26 Mon 11:36] SCHEDULED: <2024-02-26 Mon>
** DONE Cleanup the edge transfer (no more allocating, just moving)
CLOSED: [2024-02-26 Mon 11:37] SCHEDULED: <2024-02-26 Mon>
** TODO Change relax to merge as we go
SCHEDULED: <2024-02-27 Tue>

* Command to create a GCM for an import :noexport:
Like 
#+begin_src c++
  import iostream;
#+end_src
You need

Haven't found a way to automate in cmake yet. Though there should be
